This error occurs when using the `useCallback` hook in React Native with a function that uses a variable from outside its scope.  The problem is that the variable's value may change, causing unexpected behavior or rendering issues if the callback isn't properly updated.  For example:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(count + 1); // count is closed over, but its value might be stale
  }, []); // [] dependency array means useCallback won't update

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={incrementCount} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In this case, `incrementCount` closes over the `count` variable from its outer scope.  However, the empty dependency array `[]` prevents the callback from updating whenever `count` changes.  This results in `incrementCount` always using the initial value of `count` (0), regardless of how many times the button is pressed.
